# Condensed Chat Icons
So many plugins put their silly little icon in this already dense spot. On a 4:3 monitor that is straight up hell!
It literally feels like typing on a mobile phone, every 5 words it wraps to the next line.

This Theme fixes that by wrapping the icons. The Chat Field may be taller now, but who cares, at least you can type normally.
