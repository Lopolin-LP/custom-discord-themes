# MoreTagColors (for Vencord)
Makes Bot/Admin/Staff Tags colorful.
I made it to work with Vencord, however it may work with other things as well, if the implementation is the EXACT same.

## Customizable Values
See [background on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background), as we use the shorthand property `background`, allowing for colors, gradient and images to be used.
To change the colors for the different tags, just read the name and you'll figure out which one is for which.
As for `---tags-extra-col`... just keep it as is, it's used for apps which have a second tag (usually staff or admin).
