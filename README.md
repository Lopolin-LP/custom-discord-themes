# Lopolin's Custom Discord Themes
This Repo contains all my Custom Discord Themes I have created. They all either extend visual functionality of present features, remove unnecessary bullsh\*t nobody has asked for or make some things more convenient than before.

Each Folder has their own theme and readme inside. Check the Readme for more info about a given theme, or visit [my website](https://lopolin-lp.github.io).
