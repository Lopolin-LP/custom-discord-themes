# Lopolin's Custom Discord Themes
This Repo contains all my Custom Discord Themes I have created. They all either extend visual functionality of present features, remove unnecessary bullsh\*t nobody has asked for or make some things more convenient than before.

Each Folder has their own theme and `README.md` inside. Check the `README.md` for more info about a given theme, or visit [my website](https://lopolin-lp.github.io).

## Installation
*WARNING: Please read the `README.md` of each theme as well! It may require some extra steps than just downloading it.*
*And read the chapter "Which should I choose?" as well, thank you.*
### Load as online Theme
1. Go to the Theme's Folder you want to download
2. Click on the `.source.css`\* or `.main.css` file (repeat 2-5 if multiple css files are necessary)
3. Click the RAW button on the top right
4. Copy the URL of the website you've been redirected to
5. Paste the URL in the "Online Themes" section (or similar) of your modded Discord Client.

### Load from file
1. Go to the Theme's Folder you want to download
2. Click on the `.main.css`\* or `.source.css` file (repeat 2-4 if multiple css files are necessary)
3. Click the download button on the top right to download the theme
4. Follow the steps of your modded Discord Client to Import the Theme. (Usually you put it in the respective themes folder and enable it)

### Which should I choose?
TL;DR use `.main.css` when you download and `.source.css` if you load as an online theme.
- `.main.css` files should be downloaded to customize different variables, if available. It will however load the `.source.css` file as well.
  - \+ Automatic Updates
  - \+ Custom Variables can be used, if available
  - \~ If an update introduces new variables you won't notice it until you check this repo manually. (VERY UNLIKELY)
  - \~ Connects to GitHub to load the `.source.css` file every time you start Discord. (Every Theme does this already, usually as QoL.)
- `.source.css` files can be either used as an online theme or a fully offline theme.
  - \~ If downloaded it works fully offline. (Except Discord itself, ironically)
  - \- No Automatic Updates, if downloaded.
  - \- No Custom Variables when loaded as an online theme, unless you create your own to customize it.
  - \- Changing custom values isn't as user friendly

**If one of the options is not available, don't ask for one!** The `README.md` of the theme will explain why. If it doesn't answer it, then you're allowed to create an issue on this Repo.

### Customizable Values
Some Themes are customizable. To do that, simply open the CSS file in you text editor ([Visual Studio Code](https://vscode.dev), [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/) or [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org) recommended).

## Themes Overview
Name | Description | Notes
-|-|-
[Better Discord Font](https://github.com/Lopolin-LP/custom-discord-themes/tree/main/better-discord-font) | CSS to revert Discord's font change and use Noto Emoji Color instead of your system's Emojis. | 1
[Condensed Chat Icons](https://github.com/Lopolin-LP/custom-discord-themes/tree/main/condensed-chat-icons) | So many plugins put their silly little icon in this already dense spot. This will wrap the gift, emoji, gif, etc. icons to the next line if the chat input field needs more space.
[DnD Disable DC](https://github.com/Lopolin-LP/custom-discord-themes/tree/main/dnd-disable-dc) | Removes everything in Discord when on DnD. Yes, no distraction, what DnD should be. | 2
[More Tag Colors (Vencord)](https://github.com/Lopolin-LP/custom-discord-themes/tree/main/more-tag-colors-vencord) | Makes Bot/Admin/Staff Tags colorful.
[Username Chat Readability On Hover](https://github.com/Lopolin-LP/custom-discord-themes/tree/main/username-chat-readability-on-hover) | Black Theme, Black Username. Good luck reading it in chat. Now you can when you hover over it.

1 - Requires different installation steps, see `README.md`
2 - Potential performance issues, impact varies.
