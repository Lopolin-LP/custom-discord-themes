# Lopolin's Custom Discord Themes
This Repo contains all my Custom Discord Themes I have created. They all either extend visual functionality of present features, remove unnecessary bullsh\*t nobody has asked for or make some things more convenient than before.

Each Folder has their own theme and readme inside. Check the Readme for more info about a given theme, or visit [my website](https://lopolin-lp.github.io).

## Installation
### Load as online Theme
1. Go to the Theme's Folder you want to download
2. Click on the CSS/Theme File (repeat 2-5 if multiple css files are necessary)
3. Click the RAW button on the top right
4. Copy the URL of the website you've been redirected to
5. Paste the URL in the "Online Themes" section (or similar) of your modded Discord Client.

### Load from file offline
1. Go to the Theme's Folder you want to download
2. Click on the CSS/Theme File (repeat 2-4 if multiple css files are necessary)
3. Click the download button on the top right to download the theme
4. Follow the steps of your modded Discord Client to Import the Theme. (Usually either put it in the respective themes folder and enable it)

### Which should I choose?
If you don't want to customize any of the variables you can use the online theme.
If you want to customize the variables download the file. You need to manually re-download it again if it breaks and it doesn't have a built-in update function.
All my themes which are only one file do not have auto update functionality. Might add it if there is demand.

## Themes Overview
Name + Link | Description | Notes

[Condensed Chat Icons](https://github.com/Lopolin-LP/custom-discord-themes/tree/main/condensed-chat-icons) | So many plugins put their silly little icon in this already dense spot. On a 4:3 monitor that is straight up hell! |

## ToDo
